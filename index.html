        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                We've organised the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description. Here, we can describe the chart and give some context.
                As a first example, we're using a basic chart from our repo.
