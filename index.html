        <h3>A locally stored chart</h3>

        <p> The chart below shows how real GDP per capita has changed over time for six different countries.

        <h3>Using FRED to create a chart</h3>

        <p> This chart shows a line chart tracking the share of total U.S. net worth held by the top 0.1% over time.

            <h2>Coding Challenge 3: Debate </h2>

<p> Position: Governments should prioritise growth-oriented tax cuts even when unfunded, as economic expansion will generate offsetting revenues. Truss's mini-budget will be used as a case-study. </p>  

                                    <h3>Impact on Bank Rate</h3>

             <figure id="Location6"></figure> 
                </div>

<p> Refute #1: Unfunded tax cuts in Truss’s 2022 mini-budget fueled inflation fears, prompting steeper rate hikes that stifled growth instead of boosting it. </p>
    </section>

    
                                    <h3>Impact on Gilt Yield</h3>

             <figure id="Location7"></figure> 
                </div>


<p> Refute #2: Truss’s 2022 mini-budget spiked gilt yields and crashed investor confidence, proving unfunded tax cuts can destabilise markets, not generate offsetting revenues. </p>

             <figure id="Location9"></figure> 
                </div>

         <p>I replaced misleading rank bars with actual happiness scores, showing true differences, correct direction, and clearer context - making the chart accurate and easier to read. </p>
